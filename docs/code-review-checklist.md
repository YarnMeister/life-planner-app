  - `src/components/life-planner/reflect/RatingsPillarsColumn.tsx`

## Alignment to Requirements

- Reflect workflow present with: list of pillars, per-pillar themes, sliders to rate, summary, and completion.
- Modal-based stepper with mood capture, rating, and summary steps implemented.
- Ratings persist via `useLifeOS().updateTheme`; sequential saves avoid version conflicts.
- Last reflection metadata persisted to `localStorage` and displayed in `ReflectTab` (Today/Yesterday/days ago).
- Desktop and mobile layouts handled via `useMediaQuery`.

Conclusion: Functionality matches RTS-53 intent. No scope creep detected.

## Implementation Quality and Efficiency

- Data loading: `ReflectTab` loads pillars/themes on mount using `Promise.all` — efficient.
- Debounced writes: `RatingsThemesColumn` uses `useDebouncedValue(500ms)` inside `ThemeRatingCard` to avoid chatty updates — good.
- Conflict avoidance: `ReflectModal` saves sequentially, explaining optimistic locking concerns — good rationale.
- Local state: `savingThemeIds` set for per-theme spinners; clean UX.
- Resilience: `localStorage` JSON parse wrapped in try/catch — safe.
- Separation of concerns: Pillars/Themes split into focused components; modal encapsulates reflection flow and stats — clear structure.

Notable suggestions:
- Consider a store/service-level batch update API (single request/transaction) to save all ratings atomically from the modal; keeps UI responsive and avoids version drift during lengthy saves.
- In `ReflectTab`, the last reflection refresh reads `localStorage` again; optionally lift this into a small helper to DRY and validate shape.
- Add error toasts/surface for failed saves in `RatingsThemesColumn` (hook may notify, but user feedback from this UI would help).

## Naming, Module Structure, and README Guidelines

- File locations and names align with project organization in README.
- Component names are nouns; handler names are verb phrases; props typed explicitly.
- Styling leverages Mantine consistently; no ad hoc CSS anomalies spotted.

No violations found.

## Test Playbook Adherence and Unit Tests

- Tests live next to source; naming uses `.test.tsx` — ✅
- Cleanup handled globally via `src/tests/setup.ts` — ✅
- External dependencies mocked (hooks, Mantine hooks where needed) — ✅
- Behavior-focused tests (rendering, interactions, states) — ✅
- No raw network/db calls — ✅

Coverage observations:
- `ReflectTab.test.tsx`: verifies data loads, loading state, modal open/close, last reflection formatting.
- `RatingsPillarsColumn.test.tsx`: list render, ratings display, domain badges, selection behavior, empty state.
- `RatingsThemesColumn.test.tsx`: themed list render, ratings text, note display, "no pillar" prompt, empty state, sliders presence.
- `ReflectModal.test.tsx`: step navigation, progress text, summary statistics render, closed state.

Recommended test additions:
- `RatingsThemesColumn`: simulate slider change and assert `updateTheme` called with expected arguments and saving indicator toggle.
- `ReflectTab`: test mobile layout (mock `useMediaQuery` to return true) to ensure header/button and columns render correctly.
- `ReflectModal`: verify sequential save path calls `updateTheme` per rated theme and writes `lifeOS:lastReflection` with expected shape; consider injecting a storage abstraction for easier assertion.
- Add one error-path test (e.g., `updateTheme` reject) to ensure UI resilience and any notifications are triggered.
- Prefer less brittle queries in tests (see notes below).

## Raw SQL and Migrations

- No raw SQL introduced in these changes.
- No migration files modified; all persistence uses existing store/service paths.

Compliant with migration hygiene.

---

## Accessibility and UX

- Buttons have descriptive text; Stepper labels/descriptions present.
- Mantine `Slider` provides labels; visible percentage text helps screen-reader context.
- Modal uses `closeOnClickOutside={false}` to protect progress — good.

Suggestions:
- Consider `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` for sliders to reinforce context (theme name already nearby, but aria linkage would help).
- Provide a visible confirmation/toast on successful completion of reflection.

---

## Performance Considerations

- Debounce on per-theme sliders reduces write volume.
- For large theme counts, consider virtualized list within modal and themes column to limit DOM size.
- If batch API implemented, combine with server-side transaction for O(1) round-trips.

---

## Minor Code Review Notes (Polish/Brittleness)

- Tests using DOM selectors:
  - `ReflectTab.test.tsx`: loading check via `.mantine-Loader-root` is library-implementation-coupled. Prefer a stable hook (e.g., add `aria-label="loading"` on `Loader` and query by role/label) or `data-testid`.
  - `RatingsPillarsColumn.test.tsx`: `closest('div[class*="Card"]')` is brittle. Prefer clicking the `Card` via a role or add `data-testid` to the Card.
- `ReflectTab`: `formatLastReflection` could be extracted and unit-tested in isolation, but current inline coverage via integration tests is acceptable.
- `ReflectModal`: statistics sorting is correct; consider displaying absolute change sign consistently (`+`/`-`). For declined list, label already shows negative value — consistent.
- `ReflectModal`: `overallNote` is collected but not persisted; consider future design to store it if needed or intentionally omit for privacy.

---

## Security/State Integrity

- Sequential updates mitigate optimistic locking conflicts; still, a batch endpoint would ensure atomicity and simpler rollback semantics.
- LocalStorage usage is non-sensitive (summary meta only). No secrets or PII written.

---

## Decision

- Meets acceptance criteria and coding/testing guidelines.
- Recommend merge after addressing optional test polish items; batch update is an enhancement, not a blocker.

---

## Actionable Recommendations (Prioritized)

1) Add targeted tests to reduce brittleness and increase behavior coverage:
   - RatingsThemesColumn: assert `updateTheme` on slider change and spinner toggle.
   - ReflectTab: mobile layout case (mock `useMediaQuery`).
   - ReflectModal: ensure `updateTheme` called for each rated theme; assert `localStorage` write; add one error-path.
   - Replace brittle selectors with `role`, `label`, or `data-testid`.

2) Consider a batch `updateThemes` API in the store/service for the modal completion path to improve atomicity and performance.

3) Optional UX: toast on completion; aria linkage between slider and theme label for improved SR experience.
